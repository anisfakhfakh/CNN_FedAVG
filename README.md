# CNN_FedAVG
This project studies the use of Federated Averaging aggregation method on MNIST Fashion CNN training.
My other projects will be porgressively uploaded at the [main GitHub repo](https://github.com/anisfakhfakh).

#### -- Project Status: [Complete]

## Project Objective
Compare performance (basically Accuracy) of applying Federated Averaging while training to a MNIST Fashion CNN classification model: 10 local devices (local models) and one aggergating server (centralized model).
